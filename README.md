# fise.js
This is a simple file server with **node.js**, **express**, **pug** and other technologies.
I started this project for a simple reason.
+ *To learn and practice JS and NodeJS*.

I'm new with JS and NodeJS, so I decided start this simple project to share what I learn and receive feedback from other developers who could want correct me or help me to improve it (even with my english because I don't speak it natively).

# Getting Started

#### Requirements

* nodejs >= 4
* npm >= 2
* git >= 2 || direct download

#### Download and install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewrosvel/fisejs.git && cd fisejs
$ npm install
```

#### Run server

```
$ npm start
```

# What it does?
Simple, it's useful to *upload/download* files in a network, just put the files in the **/files** directory and that's all.

# :)
Feel free to correct me or suggest improvements through **GitHub** or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewrosvel "@andrewrosvel").
I'll try to make it better with time, this is my first NodeJS project, so... :)
