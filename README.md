# fise.js
This is a simple file server with **node.js**, **express**, **pug** and other technologies.
I started this project for a simple reason.
+ *To learn and practice JS and NodeJS*.

I'm new with JS and NodeJS, so I decided start this simple project to share what I learn and receive feedback from other developers who could want correct me or help me to improve it (even with my english because I don't speak it natively).

## What it does?
Simple, it's useful to *upload/download* files in a network, just put the files in the **fisejs/files** directory and that's all.

## :)
Feel free to correct me or suggest improvements through **GitHub** or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewrosvel "@andrewrosvel").
I'll try to make it better with time, this is my first NodeJS project, so...
:)
